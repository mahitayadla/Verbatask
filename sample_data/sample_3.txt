00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Henry: We detected suspicious login attempts on several accounts last night.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Alice: How many accounts are we talking about?

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Henry: About fifteen. Two look fully compromised.

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Bob: Do we know how they got in?

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Henry: Credential stuffing. Old passwords from a third party breach.

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Alice: We need to force resets on those two accounts immediately.

7
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Henry: Already done. But I think we should reset all accounts older than two years.

8
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Bob: That's a large user base. Communication needs to be careful.

9
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Emma: I'll draft the notification email today and send it to you for review Henry.

10
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Henry: Thanks. We should also enforce MFA across the board.

11
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Bob: I can implement that on the backend. Two days minimum.

12
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Alice: Bob get started on that today please.

13
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Frank: Legal needs to be informed. I'll brief them this afternoon.

14
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Henry: Good. Bob can you also go through the access logs and flag anything else suspicious?

15
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Bob: I'll go through them today and send you a summary by tonight.

16
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Alice: Should we bring in an external security firm?

17
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Henry: Let's wait for Bob's audit first then decide.

18
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Frank: I'll also check if we have any disclosure obligations given the breach.

19
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Alice: Good thinking. Let's regroup tomorrow morning.
