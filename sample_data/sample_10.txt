00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Grace: Let's run through the QBR numbers before we present to the board.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Frank: Revenue is up twelve percent quarter over quarter.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Grace: Good. What about churn?

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Frank: Slightly up. Three percent versus two last quarter.

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Grace: That needs attention. Carol can you dig into the churn data and identify the top reasons?

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Carol: I'll have an analysis ready by Thursday.

7
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Henry: Engineering velocity was down this quarter due to the infrastructure work.

8
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Grace: Henry can you put together a slide explaining that for the board?

9
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Henry: I'll have it ready by tomorrow.

10
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Bob: NPS scores dropped slightly too. From 42 to 38.

11
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Grace: That's concerning. Bob what's driving it?

12
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Bob: Mostly complaints about response times and the new UI changes.

13
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Grace: We need a plan to address that. Bob can you draft a short term improvement plan?

14
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Bob: I'll put something together by end of week.

15
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Emma: The support team is also understaffed. That's contributing to response time issues.

16
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Grace: Emma can you work with HR to open two support roles?

17
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Emma: I'll send the job descriptions to HR today.

18
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
David: Should we include a competitive analysis in the QBR deck?

19
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Grace: Good idea. David can you pull that together?

20
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
David: I'll have two or three slides ready by Wednesday.

21
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Grace: Perfect. Let's do a final review of the full deck Friday morning.
