00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Sarah: Okay let's get started. We need to finalize the product launch for next month.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
James: The landing page is still not ready. Design has been delayed.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Sarah: Lisa can you get the landing page done by Thursday?

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Lisa: Yes I'll have it ready by Thursday morning.

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
James: We also need the pricing finalized. That's blocking marketing.

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Sarah: Mark can you send the final pricing sheet to the team by tomorrow?

7
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Mark: I'll have it done by end of day today.

8
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
James: The API integration is still failing in staging. It's a blocker.

9
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Sarah: That's critical. James you need to fix that ASAP.

10
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
James: I'll get on it immediately after this call.

11
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Lisa: Should we set up a QA round once the landing page is done?

12
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Sarah: Yes. Tom can you coordinate QA testing for next Monday?

13
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Tom: Sure I'll set that up and send calendar invites to everyone.

14
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Mark: We should also brief the sales team before launch.

15
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Sarah: Good point. Mark can you handle that briefing by next Wednesday?

16
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Mark: I'll schedule it for Tuesday so they have time to prepare.

17
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Tom: Do we have the legal disclaimer copy ready for the site?

18
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Sarah: Not yet. Lisa can you follow up with legal and get that whenever possible?

19
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Lisa: I'll reach out to them today.

20
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Sarah: Great. Let's regroup Friday to check on everything.
