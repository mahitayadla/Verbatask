1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Grace: Let's talk about where the roadmap stands for Q2.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Carol: The search feature is running behind. About two weeks.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Grace: What's causing it?

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Carol: We're blocked on the indexing service. It's not ready yet.

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Henry: That's my team. We hit unexpected complexity in the schema design.

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Grace: Henry when can you realistically deliver?

7
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Henry: End of next week if nothing major comes up.

8
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Carol: That still leaves us tight. I need at least three days after that.

9
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Grace: So search ships end of month at earliest. Carol update the roadmap doc today.

10
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Carol: I'll update it this afternoon.

11
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
David: The export feature depends on the same indexing work so that slides too.

12
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Grace: Can you note that dependency in the roadmap Carol?

13
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Carol: Yes I'll add it when I update it.

14
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Grace: Henry I also need a written status update from your team by Friday.

15
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Henry: I'll send it by end of day Friday.

16
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Grace: We should also loop in leadership on this delay. I'll handle that conversation.

17
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
David: Should we prepare talking points?

18
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Grace: Good idea. David can you draft those by tomorrow morning?

19
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
David: I'll have something ready.

20
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Grace: Thanks everyone. Let's regroup Monday.
