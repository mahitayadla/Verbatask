00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Alice: We need to talk about the data anomaly flagged this morning.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
David: I pulled the logs. Looks like a misconfigured S3 bucket was publicly accessible for about six hours.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Alice: What data was exposed?

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
David: Mostly internal reports. No customer PII as far as I can tell.

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Frank: We should verify that thoroughly before making any statements.

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
David: Agreed. I'll do a full audit of the bucket contents today.

7
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Alice: Frank can you check our legal obligations around disclosure?

8
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Frank: I'll review the policy and get back to you by this afternoon.

9
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Henry: We need to fix the bucket configuration immediately.

10
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
David: It's already locked down. But I'll audit all other buckets for similar issues.

11
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Alice: Good. How long will that take?

12
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
David: I can have a full report by tomorrow morning.

13
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Emma: Should we notify leadership now or wait for the audit?

14
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Alice: I'll brief them now with what we know and update them after David's report.

15
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Frank: We should also review our cloud security policies.

16
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Henry: I'll schedule a security review for next week and pull in the relevant team leads.

17
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Carol: Should we update our incident response playbook based on this?

18
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Alice: Yes. Carol can you take ownership of that?

19
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Carol: I'll have an updated version ready by end of next week.

20
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Alice: Thanks everyone. Let's stay on top of this.
